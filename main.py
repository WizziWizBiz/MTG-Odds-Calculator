"""This program prompts inputs for number of cards that the user wants to play on turns 1-4, and the number of lands in the deck.
  The program then calculates the odds of playing a land and a card on turns 1-5, with turn 5 being the commander.
  It will then output this result, along with the number of remaining slots in the deck for other cards (e.g. removal, draw, etc)."""
